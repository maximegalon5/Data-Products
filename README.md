# Data-Products-Submission

This repo contains the project files for a submission to the Data Products Coursera Module (part of the Data Science Specialization offered by JHU).

The applet can be found here - https://gormonjee.shinyapps.io/Fun_with_weight/

The pitchdeck can be found here - http://rpubs.com/maximegalon5/DP_W_4

The script for transforming the original brfss dataset is also contained within the repo (brfss_minidata_script.R)

The motivation for the app (apart from fulfilling the course requirements) can be found under the documentation tab in the app itself.
